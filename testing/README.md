# Testing

You can easily test this application without a client, using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to send HTTP Multipart/form requests.

**Creating a Postman request:**
1. Create a new POST request
2. Choose `form-data` type
3. Add key with type `File`, and name whatever
4. Do not set Content-type Header, Postman will do this for you
